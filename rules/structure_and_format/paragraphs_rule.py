        This rule is a placeholder and does not perform analysis.

        Reasoning:
        The IBM Style Guide rules for paragraphs concern visual formatting,
        specifically indentation and the use of empty lines between paragraphs.
        An analyzer that processes raw text sentence by sentence cannot see
        this formatting.

        A robust implementation would require a pre-processing step where the
        source document is parsed in a way that preserves its visual layout
        information, which is beyond the scope of a purely linguistic analysis.
