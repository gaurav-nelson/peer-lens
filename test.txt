When I test this .adoc file:

= Document Title for Testing IBM Style

// This document is designed to trigger a wide range of IBM Style Guide rules.

== Configuring The System For The First Time.

This initial section describes how to setup the new server. The system wants you to input your first name and last name. We will begin by having you click on the "Start" button. This is an easy process. For details, click here. The server costs $4M.


The paragraph paragraph gives multiple duplicate "
references citations" errors:

ideally it should only display 2 "references citations" errors

1. Problematic link text: 'click'. Use descriptive link text.
Suggestion: Provide context for the action

2. Problematic link text: 'click here'. Use descriptive link text.
Suggestion: Use descriptive link text that makes sense out of context

Why are other duplicate "references citations" errors displaying. Are they reallty duplicate or they are just other errors which are getting triggers but are false flags here?

Just find the issue and don't solve. Just discuss
