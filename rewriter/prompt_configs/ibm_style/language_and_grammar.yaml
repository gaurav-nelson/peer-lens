# IBM Style Guide - Language and Grammar Rules
# This file maps error types from the analyzer to specific, human-readable
# instructions for the AI Rewriter model, now with prioritization.

rules:
  # PRIMARY COMMAND for critical language and grammar fixes
  language_priority:
    # This more nuanced command tells the AI to distinguish between instructions
    # (which should be second person) and descriptions (which should be third person).
    # This prevents the AI from over-correcting and changing the meaning of the text.
    primary_command: "CRITICAL: Return ONLY the corrected text with NO explanations. Apply these fixes: 1) Use second person ('you') for instructions, third person for system descriptions. Remove 'we', 'our'. 2) Convert passive to active voice."

  abbreviations:
    instruction: "Fix issues with abbreviations. Do not use Latin abbreviations like 'e.g.' or 'i.e.'; use their English equivalents. Spell out unfamiliar abbreviations on first use."

  adverbs_only:
    instruction: "Review the placement of the word 'only' to ensure it modifies the correct word and the meaning is unambiguous."

  anthropomorphism:
    instruction: "Rewrite sentences to remove anthropomorphism. Do not give human-like actions or thoughts to inanimate objects like systems or applications. Focus on the user's actions."

  articles:
    instruction: "Correct any article errors, ensuring 'a' is used before consonant sounds and 'an' is used before vowel sounds."

  capitalization:
    instruction: "Apply sentence-style capitalization. Only capitalize the first word and proper nouns. Return ONLY the corrected text."

  conjunctions:
    instruction: "Ensure conjunctions are used correctly. For example, use 'since' only to refer to time (not as a replacement for 'because') and 'while' only to refer to a period of time (not as a replacement for 'although')."

  contractions:
    instruction: "For a formal tone, spell out contractions (e.g., use 'do not' instead of 'don't')."

  inclusive_language:
    instruction: "Replace non-inclusive terms with the preferred, modern alternatives (e.g., use 'allowlist' instead of 'whitelist')."

  plurals:
    instruction: "Fix pluralization errors. Do not use constructions like '(s)' to indicate a plural."

  possessives:
    instruction: "Correct errors in possessives. For example, do not use an apostrophe-'s' with an abbreviation; rewrite using a prepositional phrase (e.g., 'the properties of the API' instead of 'the API's properties')."

  prepositions:
    instruction: "Simplify sentences that contain too many prepositions to improve clarity."

  pronouns:
    instruction: "CRITICAL: Ensure pronouns are used correctly. The text must address the user directly with 'you' (second person). Avoid first-person ('we', 'our') and gender-specific ('he', 'she') pronouns."

  spelling:
    instruction: "Correct spelling to conform to US English, as required by the IBM Style Guide (e.g., use 'center' not 'centre')."

  terminology:
    instruction: "Replace non-preferred or outdated terminology with the correct terms specified in the IBM Style Guide (e.g., use 'uninstall' not 'de-install')."

  verbs:
    instruction: "CRITICAL: Use the present tense and active voice. Convert all passive sentences to active ones to be more direct and clear."

  sentence_length:
    instruction: "Break overly long sentences into shorter, clearer ones (15-20 words each)."
  
  conciseness:
    instruction: "Remove wordy phrases and unnecessary words."
  
  clarity:
    instruction: "Replace complex words with simpler alternatives."
  
  article_usage:
    instruction: "Correct article usage (a, an, the). Use 'a' before consonant sounds, 'an' before vowel sounds, and 'the' for specific references."

  # AMBIGUITY DETECTION RULES
  ambiguity:
    primary_command: "CRITICAL: This text contains ambiguous content that requires clarification. You MUST resolve all ambiguities by identifying missing actors, clarifying unclear references, and making all meaning explicit."
    instruction: "Resolve ambiguity by clearly specifying who or what performs actions, what pronouns refer to, and ensuring all references are unambiguous."
    
  missing_actor:
    instruction: "CRITICAL: This sentence uses passive voice without specifying who or what performs the action. You MUST identify and specify the actor (e.g., 'the system', 'you', 'the administrator') performing the action."
    examples:
      - "BEFORE: This is configured automatically."
      - "AFTER: The system configures this automatically."
      - "AFTER: You configure this automatically."
    
  ambiguous_pronoun:
    instruction: "CRITICAL: This sentence contains a pronoun with an unclear referent. Replace the ambiguous pronoun with the specific noun it refers to."
    examples:
      - "BEFORE: The server connects to the gateway. It is fast."
      - "AFTER: The server connects to the gateway. The connection is fast."
      - "AFTER: The server connects to the gateway. The server is fast."
      
  unclear_subject:
    instruction: "Clarify the unclear subject by specifying exactly what entity you are referring to."
    
  ambiguous_modifier:
    instruction: "Restructure the sentence to clarify what the modifier is describing."
    
  vague_quantifier:
    instruction: "Replace vague quantifiers (some, many, several) with specific numbers or ranges when possible."
    
  unclear_temporal:
    instruction: "Specify exact timing or sequence instead of using vague temporal references like 'then' or 'later'."
    
  # CRITICAL AI REWRITER CONSTRAINTS
  unsupported_claims:
    primary_command: "CRITICAL: This text contains unsupported claims or promises. You MUST NOT strengthen claims beyond what can be substantiated."
    instruction: "Replace strong claims with more measured language. Avoid absolute guarantees, promises, or claims that cannot be verified."
    examples:
      - "WRONG: Change 'ensures' to 'guarantees'"
      - "CORRECT: Keep 'ensures' or use 'helps ensure', 'is designed to'"
      - "WRONG: Use 'always', 'never', 'perfect', 'foolproof'"
      - "CORRECT: Use 'typically', 'rarely', 'reliable', 'straightforward'"
    constraints:
      - "Never strengthen claims beyond the original text"
      - "Do not make promises that cannot be substantiated"
      - "Use qualifying language when appropriate"
    
  fabrication_risk:
    primary_command: "CRITICAL: This text has high risk of information fabrication. You MUST NOT add any information not present in the original text."
    instruction: "Do not add purposes, explanations, methods, or details that are not explicitly stated in the original text."
    examples:
      - "WRONG: Add 'to verify data accuracy' when not in original"
      - "CORRECT: Keep vague actions vague if original is vague"
      - "WRONG: Specify technical details not mentioned"
      - "CORRECT: Preserve the level of detail from original"
    constraints:
      - "Do not add information not in the original text"
      - "Do not invent purposes or explanations"
      - "Preserve the level of specificity from the original"
      - "When in doubt, keep it general"
    
  excessive_certainty:
    instruction: "Replace overly confident language with more measured alternatives that accurately reflect the level of certainty."
