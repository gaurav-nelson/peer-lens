# IBM Style Guide - Language and Grammar Rules
# This file maps error types from the analyzer to specific, human-readable
# instructions for the AI Rewriter model, now with prioritization.

rules:
  # PRIMARY COMMAND for critical language and grammar fixes
  language_priority:
    # This more nuanced command tells the AI to distinguish between instructions
    # (which should be second person) and descriptions (which should be third person).
    # This prevents the AI from over-correcting and changing the meaning of the text.
    primary_command: "FIRST, apply these CRITICAL language and grammar fixes: 1) Rewrite the text to address the user directly. Use the second person ('you') for all instructions or actions the user should take. Remove first-person pronouns like 'we' and 'our'. For descriptive statements about how a system or framework behaves on its own, maintain the third person. 2) Convert all passive voice to active voice."

  abbreviations:
    instruction: "Fix issues with abbreviations. Do not use Latin abbreviations like 'e.g.' or 'i.e.'; use their English equivalents. Spell out unfamiliar abbreviations on first use."

  adverbs_only:
    instruction: "Review the placement of the word 'only' to ensure it modifies the correct word and the meaning is unambiguous."

  anthropomorphism:
    instruction: "Rewrite sentences to remove anthropomorphism. Do not give human-like actions or thoughts to inanimate objects like systems or applications. Focus on the user's actions."

  articles:
    instruction: "Correct any article errors, ensuring 'a' is used before consonant sounds and 'an' is used before vowel sounds."

  capitalization:
    instruction: "Apply sentence-style capitalization. Do not use headline-style capitalization for headings or titles. Only capitalize the first word and any proper nouns."

  conjunctions:
    instruction: "Ensure conjunctions are used correctly. For example, use 'since' only to refer to time (not as a replacement for 'because') and 'while' only to refer to a period of time (not as a replacement for 'although')."

  contractions:
    instruction: "For a formal tone, spell out contractions (e.g., use 'do not' instead of 'don't')."

  inclusive_language:
    instruction: "Replace non-inclusive terms with the preferred, modern alternatives (e.g., use 'allowlist' instead of 'whitelist')."

  plurals:
    instruction: "Fix pluralization errors. Do not use constructions like '(s)' to indicate a plural."

  possessives:
    instruction: "Correct errors in possessives. For example, do not use an apostrophe-'s' with an abbreviation; rewrite using a prepositional phrase (e.g., 'the properties of the API' instead of 'the API's properties')."

  prepositions:
    instruction: "Simplify sentences that contain too many prepositions to improve clarity."

  pronouns:
    instruction: "CRITICAL: Ensure pronouns are used correctly. The text must address the user directly with 'you' (second person). Avoid first-person ('we', 'our') and gender-specific ('he', 'she') pronouns."

  spelling:
    instruction: "Correct spelling to conform to US English, as required by the IBM Style Guide (e.g., use 'center' not 'centre')."

  terminology:
    instruction: "Replace non-preferred or outdated terminology with the correct terms specified in the IBM Style Guide (e.g., use 'uninstall' not 'de-install')."

  verbs:
    instruction: "CRITICAL: Use the present tense and active voice. Convert all passive sentences to active ones to be more direct and clear."

  sentence_length:
    instruction: "Break overly long sentences into shorter, clearer ones (15-20 words each)."
  
  conciseness:
    instruction: "Remove wordy phrases and unnecessary words."
  
  clarity:
    instruction: "Replace complex words with simpler alternatives."
  
  article_usage:
    instruction: "Correct article usage (a, an, the). Use 'a' before consonant sounds, 'an' before vowel sounds, and 'the' for specific references."
