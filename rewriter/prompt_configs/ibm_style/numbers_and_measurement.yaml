# IBM Style Guide - Numbers and Measurement Rules
# Each rule follows the pattern: primary_command + instruction + examples + fallback

rules:
  # GLOBAL PRIMARY COMMAND
  numbers_priority:
    primary_command: "CRITICAL: Output ONLY the corrected text. NO explanations. Apply number and measurement formatting rules for clarity and international consistency."

  numbers_currency:
    primary_command: "CRITICAL: Output ONLY the corrected text. NO explanations."
    instruction: "Fix currency formatting to use ISO codes and full numbers."
    transformations:
      - pattern: "Letter multiplier -> Full number"
        examples:
          - "The contract is worth USD 4M. -> The contract is worth USD 4,000,000."
      - pattern: "Symbol -> ISO code"
        examples:
          - "The cost is $100. -> The cost is USD 100."
    fallback: "Replace currency symbols with three-letter ISO codes and spell out numeric multipliers."

  numbers_dates_times:
    primary_command: "CRITICAL: Output ONLY the corrected text. NO explanations."
    instruction: "Standardize date and time formats."
    transformations:
      - pattern: "Numeric date (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY) -> Spelled-out month"
        examples:
          - "The release on 9/12/2023... -> The release on 12 September 2023..."
      - pattern: "Incorrect AM/PM -> Standard AM/PM"
        examples:
          - "The meeting is at 2:30 p.m. -> The meeting is at 2:30 PM."
          - "It starts at 9 am. -> It starts at 9 AM."
    fallback: "Use the format 'DD Month YYYY' for dates and uppercase 'AM'/'PM' for times."

  numbers_general:
    primary_command: "CRITICAL: Output ONLY the corrected text. NO explanations."
    instruction: "Apply standard number formatting."
    transformations:
      - pattern: "Number > 4 digits without comma -> Add comma"
        examples:
          - "The cost is 10999.99. -> The cost is 10,999.99."
      - pattern: "Decimal without leading zero -> Add leading zero"
        examples:
          - "The clearance is .25 in. -> The clearance is 0.25 in."
    fallback: "Add comma separators to large numbers and ensure decimals under 1 have a leading zero."

  numbers_numerals_vs_words:
    primary_command: "CRITICAL: Output ONLY the corrected text. NO explanations."
    instruction: "Ensure consistent use of numerals or words for small numbers."
    transformations:
      - pattern: "Mixed style -> Consistent style (prefer numerals)"
        examples:
          - "There are three servers and 10 clients. -> There are 3 servers and 10 clients."
    fallback: "Default to using numerals for all numbers for consistency."

  numbers_units_of_measurement:
    primary_command: "CRITICAL: Output ONLY the corrected text. NO explanations."
    instruction: "Fix formatting of units of measurement."
    transformations:
      - pattern: "Number attached to unit -> Add space"
        examples:
          - "The speed is 600MHz. -> The speed is 600 MHz."
          - "The size is 64KB. -> The size is 64 KB."
    fallback: "Insert a space between any number and its unit of measurement."
