# IBM Style Guide - Structure and Format Rules
# ROBUST CONFIGURATION - Systematic approach with concrete examples for every rule
# Each rule follows the pattern: primary_command + instruction + examples + fallback

rules:
  # GLOBAL PRIMARY COMMAND - applies to all structure/format rules
  structure_priority:
    primary_command: "CRITICAL: Output ONLY the corrected text. NO introductions like 'Here is', NO explanations, NO commentary, NO extra words. Just return the fixed text directly."

  headings:
    primary_command: "CRITICAL: Output ONLY the corrected heading text. NO introductions, NO explanations, NO commentary. ALWAYS capitalize the first word - sentence capitalization means FIRST word is capitalized, others lowercase except proper nouns."
    instruction: "Apply IBM Style Guide heading rules systematically - BOTH transformations are mandatory"
    transformations:
      - pattern: "MANDATORY: Gerund starts → noun equivalents (ALWAYS APPLY FIRST)"
        examples:
          - "Implementing The Fun Rules → Implementation of the fun rules"
          - "Configuring System Settings → Configuration of system settings" 
          - "Managing User Data → Management of user data"
          - "Understanding API → Overview of API"
          - "Installing Software → Installation of software"
          - "Configuring → Configuration"
          - "Managing → Management"
      - pattern: "MANDATORY: Headline Capitalization → sentence capitalization (FIRST word ALWAYS capitalized)"
        examples:
          - "Managing User Settings → Managing user settings"
          - "The Fun Rules → The fun rules" 
          - "Understanding API Basics → Understanding API basics"
          - "System Configuration → System configuration"
          - "WRONG: the fun rules → CORRECT: The fun rules"
      - pattern: "Remove ending periods"
        examples:
          - "User guide. → user guide"
    fallback: "CRITICAL: If heading starts with gerund (-ing word), convert to noun form first, then apply sentence capitalization"

  lists:
    primary_command: "CRITICAL: Output ONLY the corrected list text. NO introductions, NO explanations."
    instruction: "Make all list items grammatically parallel"
    transformations:
      - pattern: "Match first item's grammatical form"
        examples:
          - "If first item = verb phrase, all items = verb phrases"
          - "If first item = noun phrase, all items = noun phrases"
          - "Configure settings, Install software → Configure settings, Install software"
          - "User management, System configuration → User management, System configuration"
    fallback: "Convert all items to imperative verbs (Click, Enter, Select) if mixed forms"

  messages:
    primary_command: "CRITICAL: Output ONLY the corrected message text. NO introductions, NO explanations."
    instruction: "Apply professional, clear message standards"
    transformations:
      - pattern: "Remove exaggerated adjectives"
        examples:
          - "catastrophic error → connection error"
          - "fatal failure → system failure"
          - "illegal operation → invalid operation"
      - pattern: "Focus on solution, not severity"
        examples:
          - "Fatal error occurred → Cannot connect to database"
          - "Catastrophic failure → Service temporarily unavailable"
    fallback: "Use neutral, descriptive language focusing on the actual problem"

  notes:
    primary_command: "CRITICAL: Output ONLY the corrected note text. NO introductions, NO explanations."
    instruction: "Apply IBM Style Guide note formatting"
    transformations:
      - pattern: "Ensure proper label format"
        examples:
          - "Note → NOTE:"
          - "Important → IMPORTANT:"
          - "Warning → WARNING:"
      - pattern: "Complete sentences only"
        examples:
          - "Save your work → Save your work before proceeding."
          - "Check settings → Check your settings before continuing."
    fallback: "Use 'NOTE:' label followed by complete sentence with period"

  procedures:
    primary_command: "CRITICAL: Output ONLY the corrected procedure text. NO introductions, NO explanations."
    instruction: "Apply procedural step formatting standards"
    transformations:
      - pattern: "Start with imperative verbs"
        examples:
          - "You should click → Click"
          - "Next, navigate to → Navigate to"
          - "Then select → Select"
      - pattern: "Allow specific exceptions"
        examples:
          - "Optional: Configure → Optional: Configure"
          - "If needed, adjust → If needed, adjust"
    fallback: "Convert to imperative form: Click, Enter, Select, Navigate, Choose"

  # UNIVERSAL PATTERNS - apply to any structure/format issue not covered above
  structure_fallback:
    primary_command: "CRITICAL: Output ONLY the corrected text. NO introductions, NO explanations."
    instruction: "Apply IBM Style Guide formatting standards"
    transformations:
      - pattern: "Use sentence-style capitalization"
      - pattern: "Remove unnecessary punctuation"  
      - pattern: "Make language direct and clear"
      - pattern: "Use parallel structure"
    fallback: "Apply conservative formatting: lowercase except proper nouns, direct language, parallel structure"
