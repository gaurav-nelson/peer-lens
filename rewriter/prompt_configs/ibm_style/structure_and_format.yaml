  # PRIMARY COMMAND for critical structure and format fixes.
  structure_priority:
    primary_command: "CRITICAL: Output ONLY the corrected text. NO introductions like 'Here is', NO explanations, NO commentary, NO extra words. Just return the fixed text directly."

  headings:
    instruction: "Fix heading issues. CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS: 1) Use sentence-style capitalization (only first word and proper nouns capitalized). 2) Avoid starting with gerunds like 'Configuring', 'Understanding', 'Managing' - use direct nouns instead (e.g., 'Configuration', 'Understanding' → 'Overview', 'Managing' → 'Management'). 3) No ending periods. IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the corrected heading text with no explanations, notes, or commentary."

  lists:
    instruction: "Ensure all items in a list are grammatically parallel. For example, if the first item starts with a verb, all subsequent items should also start with a verb."

  messages:
    instruction: "Rewrite messages to be clear and professional. Avoid using exaggerated or alarming adjectives like 'fatal' or 'catastrophic'. Focus on describing the problem and the solution."

  notes:
    instruction: "Format notes correctly. A note label (like 'Note', 'Important', or 'Restriction') must be followed by a colon."

  procedures:
    instruction: "Ensure all steps in a procedure begin with a strong, imperative verb (e.g., 'Click', 'Enter', 'Select'). Optional or conditional steps (starting with 'Optional' or 'If') are acceptable."
