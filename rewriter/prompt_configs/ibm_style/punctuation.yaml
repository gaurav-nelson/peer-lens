rules:
  punctuation_and_symbols:
    instruction: "Do not use symbols like '&' or '+' in place of words like 'and'."
  
  colons:
    instruction: "Fix incorrect colon usage. Do not place a colon directly after a verb."

  commas:
    instruction: "Ensure all lists of three or more items use a serial (Oxford) comma before the final conjunction."

  dashes:
    instruction: "Do not use em dashes (â€”) in technical writing; rewrite the sentence using other punctuation."

  ellipses:
    instruction: "Remove ellipses (...) from the text."

  exclamation_points:
    instruction: "Remove all exclamation points and replace them with periods."

  hyphens:
    instruction: "Fix hyphenation errors, especially with common prefixes like 'pre', 'multi', and 'non'."
  
  parentheses:
    instruction: "Correct punctuation placement around parentheses."

  periods:
    instruction: "Remove periods from within uppercase abbreviations (e.g., change 'U.S.' to 'US')."

  quotation_marks:
    instruction: "Ensure punctuation (like periods and commas) is placed inside closing quotation marks."

  semicolons:
    instruction: "Avoid semicolons; rewrite complex sentences into shorter, separate sentences."

  slashes:
    instruction: "Do not use a slash (/) to mean 'and/or'; rewrite to clarify the meaning."
