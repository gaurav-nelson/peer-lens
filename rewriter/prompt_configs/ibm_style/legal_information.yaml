# IBM Style Guide - Legal Information Rules
# Each rule follows the pattern: primary_command + instruction + examples + fallback

rules:
  # GLOBAL PRIMARY COMMAND
  legal_priority:
    primary_command: "CRITICAL: Output ONLY the corrected text. NO explanations. Apply legal information rules to reduce risk and ensure clarity."

  legal_claims:
    primary_command: "CRITICAL: Output ONLY the corrected text. NO explanations."
    instruction: "Replace subjective or unsupported claims with objective, descriptive language."
    transformations:
      - pattern: "Subjective claim -> Objective description"
        examples:
          - "The system is secure. -> The system has security-enhanced features."
          - "This process is easy. -> This process involves three steps."
          - "This is the best practice. -> This is a recommended practice."
    fallback: "Remove words like 'secure', 'easy', and 'best practice'. Describe the feature or process factually."

  legal_company_names:
    primary_command: "CRITICAL: Output ONLY the corrected text. NO explanations."
    instruction: "Use the full legal name for companies."
    transformations:
      - pattern: "Common name -> Full legal name"
        examples:
          - "This feature integrates with Oracle. -> This feature integrates with Oracle Corporation."
          - "This is compatible with Microsoft. -> This is compatible with Microsoft Corporation."
    fallback: "Append the appropriate legal suffix (e.g., 'Corporation', 'Inc.') to company names."

  legal_personal_information:
    primary_command: "CRITICAL: Output ONLY the corrected text. NO explanations."
    instruction: "Use globally understood terms for personal names."
    transformations:
      - pattern: "Culturally specific term -> Global term"
        examples:
          - "Enter your first name. -> Enter your given name."
          - "Enter your last name. -> Enter your surname."
    fallback: "Replace 'first name' with 'given name' and 'last name' with 'surname'."
