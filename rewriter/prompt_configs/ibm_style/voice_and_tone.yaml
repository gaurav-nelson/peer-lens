# IBM Style Guide - Voice, Tone, and Word Choice Rules
# ROBUST CONFIGURATION - Systematic approach with concrete examples for every rule
# Each rule follows the pattern: primary_command + instruction + transformations + fallback

rules:
  # GLOBAL PRIMARY COMMAND - applies to all voice/tone rules
  voice_priority:
    primary_command: "CRITICAL: Output ONLY the corrected text. NO introductions, NO explanations. Apply voice and tone fixes systematically to ensure direct, professional communication."

  second_person:
    primary_command: "CRITICAL: Output ONLY the corrected text. NO introductions, NO explanations. Use second person ('you') for user instructions, third person for system descriptions."
    instruction: "Apply correct person perspective consistently"
    transformations:
      - pattern: "First person → second person for instructions"
        examples:
          - "We recommend that you configure → Configure"
          - "Our team will set up → You can set up"
          - "We provide the option → You have the option"
          - "Our system allows you to → You can"
      - pattern: "Remove 'we', 'our', 'us' completely"
        examples:
          - "We believe this helps → This helps"
          - "Our experience shows → Experience shows"
          - "We think you should → You should"
          - "Let us know → Contact support"
      - pattern: "Keep third person for system descriptions"
        examples:
          - "The system processes → The system processes (correct)"
          - "The application displays → The application displays (correct)"
          - "The database stores → The database stores (correct)"
    fallback: "Use 'you' for user actions, third person for system actions, eliminate all first person pronouns"

  active_voice:
    primary_command: "CRITICAL: Output ONLY the corrected text. NO introductions, NO explanations."
    instruction: "Convert passive voice to active voice consistently"
    transformations:
      - pattern: "Passive voice → active voice"
        examples:
          - "The file is processed by the system → The system processes the file"
          - "Settings can be configured by users → Users can configure settings"
          - "Data is stored in the database → The database stores data"
          - "The page is displayed to users → The system displays the page to users"
      - pattern: "Add actors to passive sentences"
        examples:
          - "The configuration is saved → The system saves the configuration"
          - "Errors are logged → The application logs errors"
          - "Results are displayed → The system displays results"
    fallback: "Identify who/what performs the action and make them the subject of the sentence"

  professional_tone:
    primary_command: "CRITICAL: Output ONLY the corrected text. NO introductions, NO explanations."
    instruction: "Maintain professional, neutral tone"

          - "super easy → straightforward"
          - "totally → completely"
          - "pretty good → effective"
      - pattern: "Overly enthusiastic → measured"
        examples:
          - "Amazing results! → Effective results."
          - "Fantastic performance! → Good performance."
          - "Incredible speed! → High performance."
    fallback: "Use neutral, professional language without casual or overly enthusiastic terms"

  word_choice:
    primary_command: "CRITICAL: Output ONLY the corrected text. NO introductions, NO explanations."
    instruction: "Use preferred IBM Style Guide terminology"
